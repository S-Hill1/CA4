Effective layout, clean, bold yet simple colours, concise information there to catch the viewer's eye and grab them in, directing them to the necessary resources on the website.
I faced many a challeneges along the way, but by starting this project when it was open i was able to work following the instructions, look back on lectures, notes or w3schools website (as directed to in the lectures) for any help. 
I feel that this work was not my best and that I struggled in completing this, however, I gave it a go in covering the steps and i belive that i have improved massively from when i fished started the course and am happy with what i was able to produce.
